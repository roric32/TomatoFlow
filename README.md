# TomatoFlow
A lean Pomodoro Timer app to help with timeboxing.

If you're not familiar with the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), 
it's a way to maintain [Flow State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) while coding or doing anything that requires focus.
In essence, you work for a certain amount of time, by default usually 25 minutes, then you take a short (usually 5 min) break.
Each time you complete a full work session, you add one to your score. Once you complete 4 cycles, you get a long (usually 30 min) break instead of a short one.

TomatoFlow is a tool to help you work in this manner.
When you click on "Work", the progress bar will begin to fill. Once the bar is full, it will automatically
switch to a short break unless your score is 4 or more, at which point it will give you a long break (Party!).

The times can be changed from the Settings->Options menu at the top of the application.
